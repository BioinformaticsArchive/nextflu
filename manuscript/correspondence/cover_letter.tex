Please find, attached, our application note entitled ``nextflu: Real-time tracking of seasonal influenza virus evolution in humans,'' which we would be grateful for your consideration for publication in \textit{Bioinformatics}.
We believe that \textit{Bioinformatics} is an appropriate venue to showcase our software application, as \nextflu{} represents a valuable contribution to public health bioinformatics as it allows better understanding of circulating viruses in an extremely timely fashion.
Source code to \nextflu{} is freely available from \url{https://github.com/blab/nextflu}, while a live web application is publicly available at \url{http://nextflu.org}.
At this point, we've received positive encouragement that \nextflu{} will be useful to several National Influenza Centers and WHO Collaborating Centers in aiding surveillance and strain selection efforts.
As such, we believe that \nextflu{} will see substantial adoption by the influenza research community.

@article{price_fasttree_2009,
	Abstract = {Gene families are growing rapidly, but standard methods for inferring phylogenies do not scale to alignments with over 10,000 sequences. We present FastTree, a method for constructing large phylogenies and for estimating their reliability. Instead of storing a distance matrix, FastTree stores sequence profiles of internal nodes in the tree. FastTree uses these profiles to implement Neighbor-Joining and uses heuristics to quickly identify candidate joins. FastTree then uses nearest neighbor interchanges to reduce the length of the tree. For an alignment with N sequences, L sites, and a different characters, a distance matrix requires O(N(2)) space and O(N(2)L) time, but FastTree requires just O(NLa + N ) memory and O(N log (N)La) time. To estimate the tree's reliability, FastTree uses local bootstrapping, which gives another 100-fold speedup over a distance matrix. For example, FastTree computed a tree and support values for 158,022 distinct 16S ribosomal RNAs in 17 h and 2.4 GB of memory. Just computing pairwise Jukes-Cantor distances and storing them, without inferring a tree or bootstrapping, would require 17 h and 50 GB of memory. In simulations, FastTree was slightly more accurate than Neighbor-Joining, BIONJ, or FastME; on genuine alignments, FastTree's topologies had higher likelihoods. FastTree is available at http://microbesonline.org/fasttree.},

@article{luksza_predictive_2014,
	Abstract = {The seasonal human influenza {A/H3N2} virus undergoes rapid evolution, which produces significant year-to-year sequence turnover in the population of circulating strains. Adaptive mutations respond to human immune challenge and occur primarily in antigenic epitopes, the antibody-binding domains of the viral surface protein haemagglutinin. Here we develop a fitness model for haemagglutinin that predicts the evolution of the viral population from one year to the next. Two factors are shown to determine the fitness of a strain: adaptive epitope changes and deleterious mutations outside the epitopes. We infer both fitness components for the strains circulating in a given year, using population-genetic data of all previous strains. From fitness and frequency of each strain, we predict the frequency of its descendent strains in the following year. This fitness model maps the adaptive history of influenza A and suggests a principled method for vaccine selection. Our results call for a more comprehensive epidemiology of influenza and other fast-evolving pathogens that integrates antigenic phenotypes with other viral functions coupled by genetic linkage.},

@article{shih_simultaneous_2007,
	Abstract = {The {HA1} domain of {HA}, the major antigenic protein of influenza A viruses, contains all of the antigenic sites of {HA} and is under continual immune-driven selection. To resolve controversies on whether only a few or many residue sites of {HA1} have undergone positive selection, whether positive selection at {HA1} is continual or punctuated, and whether antigenic change is punctuated, we introduce an approach to analyze 2,248 {HA1} sequences collected from 1968 to 2005. We identify 95 substitutions at 63 sites from 1968 to 2005 and show that each substitution occurred very rapidly. The rapid substitution and the fact that 57 of the 63 sites are antigenic sites indicate that hitchhiking plays a minor role and that most of these sites, many more than previously found, have undergone positive selection. Strikingly, 88 of the 95 substitutions occurred in groups, and multiple mutations at antigenic sites sped up the fixation process. Our results suggest that positive selection has been ongoing most of the time, not sporadic, and that multiple mutations at antigenic sites cumulatively enhance antigenic drift, indicating that antigenic change is less punctuated than recently proposed.},

@article{neher_predicting_2014,
	Abstract = {Given a sample of genome sequences from an asexual population, can one predict its evolutionary future? Here we demonstrate that the branching patterns of reconstructed genealogical trees contains information about the relative fitness of the sampled sequences and that this information can be used to predict successful strains. Our approach is based on the assumption that evolution proceeds by accumulation of small effect mutations, does not require species specific input and can be applied to any asexual population under persistent selection pressure. We demonstrate its performance using historical data on seasonal influenza A/H3N2 virus. We predict the progenitor lineage of the upcoming influenza season with near optimal performance in 30\% of cases and make informative predictions in 16 out of 19 years. Beyond providing a tool for prediction, our ability to make informative predictions implies persistent fitness variation among circulating influenza A/H3N2 viruses.},

@article{koel_substitutions_2013,
	Abstract = {The molecular basis of antigenic drift was determined for the hemagglutinin ({HA)} of human influenza {A/H3N2} virus. From 1968 to 2003, antigenic change was caused mainly by single amino acid substitutions, which occurred at only seven positions in {HA} immediately adjacent to the receptor binding site. Most of these substitutions were involved in antigenic change more than once. Equivalent positions were responsible for the recent antigenic changes of influenza B and {A/H1N1} viruses. Substitution of a single amino acid at one of these positions substantially changed the virus-specific antibody response in infected ferrets. These findings have potentially far-reaching consequences for understanding the evolutionary mechanisms that govern influenza viruses.},

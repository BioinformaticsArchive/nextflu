		There were 4 clades of H3N2 viruses circulating in 2015 (3c2.a, 3c3, 3c3.a, 3c3.b, shown below). 3c2.a viruses have predominated with 78% of 2015 viruses belonging to clade 3c2.a, while 12% of viruses belonged to clade 3c3.a and 6% of viruses belonged to clade 3c3.b. Clades 3c2.a, 3c3.a and 3c3.b can easily be distinguished by the residue at HA1 site 159. In 3c2.a this is tyrosine (Y), in 3c3.a this is serine (S) and in 3c3.b this is phenylalanine (F).

		3c2.a has been increasing in frequency, going from 50% globally in October 2014 to 80% of post-July viruses. 3c3.a has been steadily decreasing in frequency, going from a peak of 54% in August 2014 to a present low of 10% of post-July viruses. The first 3c3.b viruses appear in the database in August 2014. They have been slow to take off; just 2% of post-July viruses belong to clade 3c3.b. In fact, 3c3.b viruses appear to have peaked in frequency in May/June at 8%. For perspective, 3c2.a viruses first appear in the database in November 2013 and reach 10% frequency in two months later in January 2014 and 50% ten months later. 3c3.b viruses show no where near this level of success. Barring additional antigenic changes, it appears that 3c2.a viruses will take over the virus population and that 3c3.a and 3c3.b will soon be extinct.

		These patterns of clade growth and decline extend to the regional level. 3c2.a viruses now dominate throughout the world, with the possible exception of Oceania, but the overall number of recent sequences available from this region is very low.

		The continued dominance of 3c2.a is corroborated with a large local branching index and comparatively low mutational load as measured by the number of non-epitope mutations since the root of the tree.

		<h3> Antigenic evolution </h3>
		
		Summarizing data from recent reports by the WHO CC London, we find that 3c2.a is about 1.5 antigenic units away from the current vaccine strain A/Switzerland/9715293/2013. HI titers between A/Switz/13 and 3c3.b also indicate a distance of about 1.5 units.

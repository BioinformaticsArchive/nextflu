# Seasonal influenza circulation and projections as of September 2015

## A(H3N2)
The majority of recently deposited viruses fall into clade 3c2a, which has been dominating since mid 2014. Judging by the sequences deposited in GISAID, 3c3a is almost extinct, while a minority of virus continue to fall into 3c3b. A few recent viruses from Oceania fall into clade 3c3b, but the overall number of recent sequences available from this region is very low.

The continued dominance of 3c2.a is corroborated with a large local branching index and comparatively low mutational load as measured by the number of non-epitope mutations since the root of the tree.


### Antigenic evolution
Summarizing data from recent reports by the WHO CC London, we find that 3c2.a is about 1.5 antigenic units away from the current vaccine strain A/Switzerland/9715293/2013. HI titers between A/Switz/13 and 3c3.b also indicate a distance of about 1.5 units.

## A(H1N1pdm)
Clade 6b has completely taken over. Within this clade, HA1:84N is starting to dominate in South Asia, while other regions are dominated by HA1:84S.

## B/Vic
Samples from the B/Victoria lineages fall into two clades with sporadic sampling of older otherwise extinct clades. 

## B/Yam
Clade 3 has fully taken over. Within this clade, different amino acids at position 251 are circulating, with 251V slowly taking over across the globe.
